# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-17-01.

Welcome to my new _new blog_ avout learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a new static site generator that uses React as a templating language. It is built by the team at [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), and it is a great tool for building fast websites.

## What I have accomplished so far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

4. **Deploying to Netlify**: I learned how to deploy my Astro site to Netlify. I also learned how to use Netlify's CMS to manage my blog posts.

## What I will do next

I will finish the Astro tutorial!!
